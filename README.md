This is the demo for the prototype that features a visibility analyser allowing users to assess whether an object stands out from its background, allowing users to evaluate if the scene is distinguishable for visually impaired visitors.

See outcome folder for tue result you can get running this code.

For the future steps, we are planning to add YOLOy8 into the process to allow the model to detect a reference point for SAM automatically, also to improve the greyscale and colour contrast function to make it more accurate.
